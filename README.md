# OFFISYS

OFFISYS is an Office Progress Management System tailored for divisional secretariat offices. The system comprises four main portals: Admin, AG (Assistant General), Department Head, and Employee Account. When beneficiaries visit the AG office for assistance related to a specific officer, that officer inputs the relevant details about the beneficiary into the system. These entries allow both the AG and Department Heads to monitor the progress of the employee's activities.
